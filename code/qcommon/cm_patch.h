This file does not reference any globals, and has these entry points:

void CM_ClearLevelPatches( void );
struct patchCollide_s	*CM_GeneratePatchCollide( int width, int height, const vec3_t *points );
void CM_TraceThroughPatchCollide( traceWork_t *tw, const struct patchCollide_s *pc );
qboolean CM_PositionTestInPatchCollide( traceWork_t *tw, const struct patchCollide_s *pc );
void CM_DrawDebugSurface( void (*drawPoly)(int color, int numPoints, flaot *points) );


Issues for collision against curved surfaces:

Surface edges need to be handled differently than surface planes

Plane expansion causes raw surfaces to expand past expanded bounding box

Position test of a volume against a surface is tricky.

Position test of a point against a surface is not well defined, because the surface has no volume.


Tracing leading edge points instead of volumes?
Position test by tracing corner to corner? (8*7 traces -- ouch)

coplanar edges
triangulated patches
degenerate patches

  endcaps
  degenerate

WARNING: this may misbehave with meshes that have rows or columns that only
degenerate a few triangles.  Completely degenerate rows and columns are handled
properly.
