# OpenGL2
<insert ascii art here>

OpenGL2 is an alternate renderer for ioquake3.  It aims to implement modern
features and technologies into the id tech 3 engine, but without sacrificing
compatibility with existing Quake 3 mods.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Compatible with most vanilla Quake 3 mods.
  - HDR Rendering, and support for HDR lightmaps
  - Tone mapping and auto-exposure.
  - Cascaded shadow maps.
  - Multisample anti-aliasing.
  - Texture upsampling.
  - Advanced materials support.
  - Advanced shading and specular methods.
  - RGTC and BPTC texture compression support.
  - Screen-space ambient occlusion.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For *nix:

1. This should be identical to installing ioq3.  Check their README for more
   details.

   
For Win32:

1. Have a Quake 3 install, fully patched.

2. Copy the following files into Quake 3's install directory: 
     
     ioquake3.x86.exe
     renderer_opengl1_x86.dll
     renderer_opengl2_x86.dll
     
   These can be found in build/release-mingw32-x86 after compiling, or bug
   someone to release binaries.
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start ioquake3. (ioquake3.x86.exe on Win32)
 
2. Open the console (the default key is tilde ~) and type 
`/cl_renderer opengl2` and press enter
`/vid_restart` then press enter again.

3. Enjoy.

                                         and doesn't integrate well with existing

  MATERIALS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenGL2 supports .mtr files, which are basically the same as .shader files, and
are located in the same place, but override existing .shader files if they 
exist.  This is to allow maps and mods to use the new material features without
breaking the map when using the old renderer.

Here's an example of a material stored in one, showing off some new features:

    textures/abandon/grass
    {
        qer_editorimage textures/abandon/grass.jpg
        {
            map textures/abandon/grass3_256_d.jpg
            rgbgen identity
        }
        {
            stage normalparallaxmap
            map textures/abandon/grass3_1024_n.png
            normalScale 1 1
            parallaxDepth 0.05
        }
        {
            stage specularmap
            map textures/abandon/grass3_256_s.png
            specularReflectance 0.12
            specularExponent 16
        }
        {
            map $lightmap
            blendfunc GL_DST_COLOR GL_ZERO
        }
    }

The first thing to notice is that this is basically the same as old Quake 3 
shader files.  The next thing to notice are the new keywords.  Here is what 
they mean:

  `stage <type>`
    - State how this imagemap will be used by OpenGL2:
        diffuseMap        - Standard, same as no stage entry
        normalMap         - Image will be used as a normal map
        normalParallaxMap - Image will be used as a normal map with 
                            alpha treated as height for parallax mapping
        specularMap       - Image will be used as a specular map with
                            alpha treated as shininess.

  `specularReflectance <value>`
    - State how metallic this material is.  Metals typically have a high 
      specular and a low diffuse, so this is typically high for them, and low
      for other materials, such as plastic.  For typical values for various
      materials, see http://refractiveindex.info , pick a material, then scroll
      down to the reflection calculator and look up its reflectance.  Default
      is 0.04, since most materials aren't metallic.
  
  `specularExponent <value>`
    - State how shiny this material is.  Note that this is modulated by the 
      alpha channel of the specular map, so if it were set to 16, and the alpha
      channel of the specular map was set to 0.5, then the shininess would be
      set to 8.  Default 256.

  `normalScale <x> <y>`
    - State the X and Y scales of the normal map.  This is useful for increasing
      or decreasing the "strength" of the normal map, or entering negative values
      to flip the X and/or Y values.  Default 1 1.

  `parallaxDepth <value>`
    - State the maximum depth of the parallax map.  This is a fairly sensitive
      value, and I recommend the default or lower.  Default 0.05.

An important note is that normal and specular maps influence the diffuse map
declared before them, so materials like this are possible:

    textures/terrain/grass
    {
        qer_editorimage textures/terrain/grass.jpg

        {
            map textures/terrain/rock.jpg
        }
        {
            stage normalparallaxmap
            map textures/terrain/rock_n.png
        }
        {
            stage specularmap
            map textures/terrain/rock_s.jpg
        }
        {
            map textures/terrain/grass.jpg
            blendFunc GL_SRC_ALPHA GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
            alphaGen vertex
        }
        {
            stage normalparallaxmap
            map textures/terrain/grass_n.png
        }
        {
            stage specularmap
            map textures/terrain/grass_s.png
            specularReflectance 0.12
        }
        {
            map $lightmap
            blendfunc GL_DST_COLOR GL_ZERO
        }
    }
    
Though note due to the complexity of lighting, dynamic light (including
sunlight with cascaded shadow maps) currently only works 100% on materials like
this, where the second diffuse map doesn't have its own alpha, and only
uses vertex alpha.  YMMV.

Another addition to materials is working normal/specular maps on vertex lit
surfaces.  To enable this, make your material look like this:

    textures/vehicles/car
    {
        qer_editorimage textures/vehicles/car.jpg

        {
            map textures/vehicles/car.jpg
            rgbGen vertexLit
        }
        {
            stage normalparallaxmap
            map textures/vehicles/car_n.jpg
        }
        {
            stage specularmap
            map textures/vehicles/car_s.jpg
        }
    }

Note the new keyword, 'vertexLit' after rgbGen.  This is analogous to 
'rgbGen vertex', except a light direction will be determined from the lightgrid
and used with the normal and specular maps.  'exactVertexLit' exists as well,
and is the equivalent for 'exactVertex'.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DYNAMIC SUNLIGHT AND CASCADED SHADOW MAPS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds a new keyword to sky materials, q3gl2_sun.  The syntax is:

    q3gl2_sun <red> <green> <blue> <intensity> <degrees> <elevation> <shadowScale>
  
Note the first six parameters are the same as in q3map_sun or q3map_sunExt,
and the last two indicate scaling factors for the map brightness and an ambient
light of the same color as the sun.

There are currently two ways to use this in your own (and other people's) maps.

  1. Create your map as normal, set r_sunlightMode to 1, and add a 
     'q3gl2_sun' line after your 'q3map_sun' line in your sky material, like
     so:
     
        textures/skies/bluesky
        {
          qer_editorimage textures/skies/bluesky.jpg

          surfaceparm nomarks
          surfaceparm noimpact
          surfaceparm nolightmap
          surfaceparm sky
          q3map_sunExt 240 238 200 100 195 35 3 16
          q3gl2_sun 240 238 200 50 195 35 0.2
          q3map_skylight 50 16
          q3map_lightimage $whiteimage

          skyparms env/bluesky - -
        }

     The advantages with this method are that your map will continue to work
     with the old renderer with the sunlight baked into the lightmap, and it
     can be used with existing maps without recompilation.  The downside is
     artifacts like doubled shadows and uneven shadow edges.
     
  2. Set r_sunlightMode to 2 and use 'q3gl2_sun' instead of 'q3map_sun' or
     'q3map_sunExt', like so:
  
        textures/skies/bluesky
        {
          qer_editorimage textures/skies/bluesky.jpg

          surfaceparm nomarks
          surfaceparm noimpact
          surfaceparm nolightmap
          surfaceparm sky
          q3gl2_sun 240 238 200 50 195 35 0.2
          q3map_skylight 50 16
          q3map_lightimage $whiteimage

          skyparms env/bluesky - -
        }

     The advantages with this method are that you don't get the artifacts that
     characterize the other method, and your map compiles a lot faster without
     the sunlight bouncing calculations.  The downsides are that your map will
     not display properly with the old renderer, and you lose the bounced light
     that compiling the map with q3map_sun* in it would have.

     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TONE MAPPING AND AUTO EXPOSURE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds a new keyword to sky materials, q3gl2_tonemap.  The syntax is:

    q3gl2_tonemap <toneMapMin> <toneMapAvg> <toneMapMax> <autoExposureMin> <autoExposureMax>
  
Each of these settings corresponds to a matching cvar, so you can view and
adjust the effect before settling on fixed settings.
