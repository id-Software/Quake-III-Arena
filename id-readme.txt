Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.


GENERAL NOTES
=============

A short summary of the file layout:

code/			   		Quake III Arena source code ( renderer, game code, OS layer etc. )
code/bspc				bot routes compiler source code
lcc/					the retargetable C compiler ( produces assembly to be turned into qvm bytecode by q3asm )
q3asm/					assembly to qvm bytecode compiler
q3map/					map compiler ( .map -> .bsp ) - this is the version that comes with Q3Radiant 200f
q3radiant/				Q3Radiant map editor build 200f ( common/ and libs/ are support dirs for radiant )

While we made sure we were still able to compile the game on Windows, GNU/Linux
and Mac, this build didn't get any kind of extensive testing so it may not work
completely right. Whenever an id game is released under GPL, several projects
start making the source code more friendly to nowaday's compilers and
environements. If you are picking up this release weeks/months/years after we
uploaded it, you probably want to look around on the net for cleaned up
versions of this codebase as well.
