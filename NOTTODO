Things we won't ever be doing!
Autotools.

Scons

New build system of the week.

Punkbuster (unless even balance wants to work with us)

Modifications to the core Quake 3: Arena/ Team Arena gameplay. Put that into
your great mod, don't screw with this.

Removing the CD Key/pk3 checksums, yes jerks are going to do this on their own,
no we aren't going to support them. Obviously that doesn't apply if you're
making a total conversion. That is, if you're not using any id data from the 
pk3s from either Team Arena or the original game itself.

Removing the SDL/OpenAL header files from SVN. Having them in SVN makes it easier
for non-Linux platforms to compile the game. This isn't changing.

MP3 support. It is already done, see: http://icculus.org/quake3/?page=patches
